## Hi! 👋 I'm Ryan,
I enjoy working on ML applications, games, and web-dev projects. 
I'm currently a Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo (2028). 

## I'm currently working on 

SemanticOS, a lightweight desktop application, built in Rust and packaged by Tauri, for fast semantic file searching. I recently trained a small-scale transformer model on Shakespeare, implementing self-attention with a bigram language model. Currently curious as to whether the idea of using random graphs to form DNN connections can also be applied to transformer architectures.
