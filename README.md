## Hi! 👋 I'm Ryan,
I enjoy working on ML applications, games, web-dev projects, and exploring new advances in LLMs. 

Software Engineering @ UWaterloo (2028), avid mechanical-keyboard hobbyist ⌨️, and swimmer 🏊. I like rock-climbing in my spare time. 

## 🖥️ I'm currently working on 

SemanticOS, a lightweight desktop application, built in Rust and packaged by Tauri, for fast semantic file searching. 

I've also recently trained a small-scale transformer model on Shakespeare, implementing self-attention with a bigram language model. Currently curious as to whether the idea of using random graphs to form DNN connections can also be applied to transformer architectures.
