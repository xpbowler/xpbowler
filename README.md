## Hi! 👋 I'm Ryan,
`Software Engineering @ UWaterloo` (class of 2028).

Incoming `Rust SWE intern @ Huawei` (Distributed Scheduling, Severless WASM)

I enjoy rock-climbing in my spare time (`stereotypical ik`) and used to ski a lot! 

## 🖥️  I'm currently working on 

[`llama-index`](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index): developed the [`rankLLM rerank`](https://pypi.org/project/llama-index-postprocessor-rankllm-rerank/) package, working on the `QueryPipeline` feature 

`SemanticOS`, a lightweight desktop application, built in Rust and packaged by Tauri, for `fast semantic file searching`.
